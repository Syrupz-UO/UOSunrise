Runic quest

Oh no the poor worried BlackSmith Feron, had her orderlist stolen by the evil Balzan marcos, and she need you to get it back.

If you can defeat the evil Balzan marcos and find the orderlist she will give you a special reward (either a runic hammer or a runic sewing kit)..


To install all you need to do is drop all the scripts except Runicquest.cfg into scripts\custom\  
drop runicquest.cfg into your \Data\Decoration\Britannia (this will spawn both in tram and fel) and once server is restarted type [decorate
(you can spawn manually if you would rather)
