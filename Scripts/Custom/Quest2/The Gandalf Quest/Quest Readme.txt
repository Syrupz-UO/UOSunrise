I went over it pretty well before releasing it..
  So it shouldn't have any bugs or errors..  
Unless you have a alike item on your shard...  

I set Sauron up with the line (Snakes Pass) in the gumps so it gives a clue where to look for him,
 You can find snakes pass close to the compassion shrine..  Once they kill the first Sauron he will transform into 
another monster and keep tring to kill them... The reward is a fairly balanced sword once they get Saurons head.. 

But all that is needed to install is drop the folder into your Scripts Folder then restart your server...
