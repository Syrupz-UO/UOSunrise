Rune Crafting & Enchanting system

This system enables scribes to craft many different runes, each one having a different effect when inscribed to weapons, armor, clothing or jewelry. 

inscription is required for crafting the runa and adding it to the equipment.

The scribe requires a Rune Chisel as the crafting tool and a blank rune in addition to casting reagents.

also Rough Stones are teh raw material that can be used to make blank runes.

This is a detailed list of the runes and their effect on equipment:

Adding the RoughStone to the ML mining system.
go to Scrips/Engines/Harvest/Mining.cs and find:

Code:
if ( Core.ML )
			{
				oreAndStone.BonusResources = new BonusHarvestResource[]
				{
					new BonusHarvestResource( 0, 95.8664, null, null ),	//Nothing	//Note: Rounded the below to .0167 instead of 1/6th of a %.  Close enough
					new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .0167, 1072562, typeof( BlueDiamond ) ),
					new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .0167, 1072567, typeof( DarkSapphire ) ),
					new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .0167, 1072570, typeof( EcruCitrine ) ),
					new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .0167, 1072564, typeof( FireRuby ) ),
					new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .0167, 1072566, typeof( PerfectEmerald ) ),
					new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .0167, 1072568, typeof( Turquoise ) )
and add the new bonus harvest resource:

Code:
                    			new BonusHarvestResource( 100, .5, "you dig up a Rough Stone and put it in your backpack", typeof( RoughStone ))//added for runecrafting

The File has been updated to include a much better working version of the system and add a few extra things that I forgot the first time arund. 
hope this version is bug free and if there are any problems let know
thanks
